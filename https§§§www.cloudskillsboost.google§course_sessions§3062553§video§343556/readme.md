* A data engineer might consider how to design a cloud data cluster so it meets customer requirements.
* A cloud engineer might run jobs on the cluster and be more focused on monitoring the cluster and measuring and maintaining its performance
* A data engineer designs the solutions and implements it.

The first approach, which is the most common, is what I call cram for the exam. That is, you start with basic information, like the information covered in our courses,

is called the mastery method
